"""Coordinate-space correctness for PyMuPDF pages.

PyMuPDF exposes two coordinate spaces that disagree whenever a page carries
rotation, a CropBox, fractional dimensions or /UserUnit:

- the UNROTATED page space that ``get_text()`` reports bboxes in, and that
  the drawing calls (``insert_textbox``, ``insert_image``,
  ``add_redact_annot``) accept;
- the DISPLAY space of ``page.rect`` and of every rendered pixmap.

Every bound check and every pixel lookup in engine/operations.py must pick
the right one. This module is the single place that knows how. See
docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-26-page-operations-design.md, rulings R2,
R3, R4, R5, R11, R12 and R16, for the evidence behind each function.
